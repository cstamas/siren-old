SIREn 0.2.1-SNAPSHOT Build Instructions

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Basic steps:
  0) Install JDK 1.6 (or greater), Maven 2.0.9 (or greater)
  1) Download SIREn 0.2.1-SNAPSHOT and unpack it
  2) Connect to the parent module directory of your SIREn installation
  3) Run maven

Step 0) Set up your development environment (JDK 1.6 or greater,
Maven 2.0.9 or greater)

We'll assume that you know how to get and set up the JDK - if you
don't, then we suggest starting at http://java.sun.com and learning
more about Java, before returning to this BUILD document. SIREn runs with
JDK 1.6 and later.

Like many Open Source java projects, SIREn uses Apache Maven for build
control.  Specifically, you MUST use Maven version 2.0.9 or greater.

Step 1) Download SIREn

We'll assume you already did this, or you wouldn't be reading this
file.  However, you might have received this file by some alternate
route, or you might have an incomplete copy of SIREn, so: SIREn
releases are available for download from:

  http://siren.sindice.com/

Download the tarred/gzipped version of the archive, and
uncompress it into a directory of your choice.

Step 2) From the command line, change (cd) into the parent module directory, 
i.e., siren-parent, of your SIREn installation

SIREn's parent module directory contains the parent pom.xml file. By default,
you do not need to change any of the settings in this file, but you do
need to run maven from this location so it knows where to find pom.xml.

Step 3) Run maven

Assuming you have maven in your PATH, typing "mvn package" at the shell prompt
and command prompt should run maven. Maven will by default look for the
"pom.xml" files in the sub-modules (siren-core, siren-qparser and siren-solr), 
compile them and run the tests.

The SIREn jar file will be located at "./target/siren-#{version}.jar".

You might want also to install them into your local maven repository by typing 
"mvn install".

To generate the javadoc, you should type "mvn javadoc:javadoc" at the shell 
prompt. Maven will generate the javadoc API in the directory 
"./target/site/apidocs/".
